# Hedging-Bot
🧠 Spot Exposure Hedging Bot

A working prototype of a risk management system that monitors real-time spot positions and automatically hedges directional exposure using perpetual futures or options.

This project showcases a fully functional Python-based hedging engine integrated with Telegram for interactive control. It connects to live cryptocurrency exchange APIs (OKX, Bybit, Deribit) to fetch market data, calculate risk metrics, and execute simulated hedge actions. Designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, it demonstrates how automated risk management can be built around real-time market analytics.

⚙️ Core Features

📊 Real-Time Risk Calculation

Computes Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega for options.

Calculates hedge ratios for perpetual futures using correlation and beta.

Monitors portfolio-level VaR, drawdown, and correlation matrices.

🤖 Automated Hedging Logic

Implements delta-neutral, options-based, and dynamic rebalancing strategies.

Supports manual and auto-execution with configurable thresholds.

Includes transaction cost and slippage estimation for realistic decisions.

💬 Telegram Bot Integration

Interactive risk alerts and performance updates.

Commands like /monitor_risk, /auto_hedge, /hedge_now, /hedge_status.

Inline buttons for actions such as “Hedge Now”, “Adjust Threshold”, “View Analytics”.
